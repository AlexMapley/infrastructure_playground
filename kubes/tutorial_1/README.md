# The Kubernetes Dashboard

The Kubernetes Dashboard is an extremely useful tool for viewing the state of a specific cluster. Development on the dashboard started back in 2016, and more info can be found at https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard.

The dashboard is great for viewing namespaces, pods, cron jobs, anything really. We're going to setup a dashboard for the local `docker-for-desktop` cluster you should have on your mac.
